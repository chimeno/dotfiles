# chimeno does dotfiles

This repository and this README is based in the original dotfiles promoted by
[@holman](http://github.com/holman).


## dotfiles

Your dotfiles are how you personalize your system. These are mine.


## Install

- `git clone git://github.com/chimeno/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles`
- `cd ~/.dotfiles`
- `git submodule init`
- `git submodule update`
- `python bootstrap.py`
- `chsh -s /bin/zsh` # Change shell in case you're using another one

This will symlink the appropriate files in `.dotfiles` to your home directory.
Everything is configured and tweaked within `~/.dotfiles`.

The main file you'll want to change right off the bat is `zsh/zshrc.symlink`,
which sets up a few paths that'll be different on your particular machine.

Everything's built around topic areas. If you're adding a new area to your
forked dotfiles — say, "Java" — you can simply add a `java` directory and put
files in there. Anything with an extension of `.zsh` will get automatically
included into your shell. Anything with an extension of `.symlink` will get
symlinked without extension into `$HOME` when you run `bootstrap`.


## Components

There's a few special files in the hierarchy.

- **bin/**: Anything in `bin/` will get added to your `$PATH` and be made
  available everywhere.
- **topic/\*.zsh**: Any files ending in `.zsh` get loaded into your
  environment.
- **topic/\*.symlink**: Any files ending in `*.symlink` get symlinked into
  your `$HOME`. This is so you can keep all of those versioned in your dotfiles
  but still keep those autoloaded files in your home directory. These get
  symlinked in when you run `rake install`.


## Recommended software

Software that it is not necessary to have but you should.

- [Brew](http://brew.sh/)
- [Python3](https://www.python.org)

## Fonts
Install fonts in the /fonts/ folder
In case of iterm2, set the font on Preferences / Profiles / Fonts (Both Font and NON-ASCII Font)

## Recommended packages

Inside the ``packages``directory there are some packages quite usefull,
that should be installed with the appropriate package manager
